NLP analysis of the Clinton/Trump presidential campaigns and debates using NLTK, topic modeling, and Word2Vec.


In preparation for the 2020 presidential campaign, performed an in-depth analysis of the previous campaign using natural language processing techniques. Created visualizations of each candidate's rhetoric and performed topic modeling on their campaign speeches, which provided an interesting bird's eye view of their respective campaign styles. Analyzed each of the three presidential debates and summarized the topics discussed by each candidate to juxtapose responses to moderator questions.
